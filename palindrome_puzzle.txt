Palindrome Puzzle Game - Project Definition
Overview:
This is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It is designed as a
one-user puzzle-style game that visually checks for palindromes.
Features:
- Displays a welcome message upon launch.
- Accepts a word via a text input field.
- Displays the word in individual letter boxes.
- Displays the reversed version of the word aligned directly beneath the input.
- Provides menu options to:
- Save the word to a dictionary (only if it is a valid palindrome).
- Show all saved palindrome words.
- Show the total number of attempts.
- Show the number of failed attempts.
- Show the number of successful attempts.
- Exit the application.
- Displays result messages such as:
- "You are successful!" for correct palindromes.
- "You failed. Again!" for non-palindromes.
- Records and displays the date of last access.
- Data is saved in a local JSON file for persistence between sessions.
Intended Use:
This project is designed for educational use in labs exploring productivity metrics
with and without AI code-assist tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT.
Additional Feature (Optional - Week 2):
Track and display the number of palindromes entered, compute the average length,
and compare each new palindrome against this average with a dynamic feedback
message.
Version:
Python Desktop Application using Tkinter.
